## Updating Quantity
When someone uses an item:
- Decrease quantity (ex: milk from 1 → 0)

When you restock:
- Increase quantity (ex: eggs 0 → 1)

---

## Low Stock Alerts
If enabled, NARLA notifies you when:
- Quantity hits 0
- Quantity drops below a threshold (ex: “below 2”)

## Shared Rules That Prevent Conflicts
Recommended:
- Use the inventory only for shared items
- If something is personal, don’t add it as shared
- Agree on who buys what categories
