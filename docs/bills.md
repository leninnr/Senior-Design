# Bills

NARLA helps you track shared bills and reduce “who still owes me?” situations.

## Adding a Bill
1. Go to **Bills**
2. Tap **Add Bill**
3. Enter:
   - Bill name (ex: “Internet”)
   - Amount (ex: $60)
   - Due date
   - Who paid (optional)
   - Split method
4. Tap **Save**

## Split Methods (Simple Explanation)
Common options:
- **Equal split**: everyone pays the same
- **Custom split**: different amounts for different roommates

Examples:
- Equal split: $120 / 3 roommates → $40 each
- Custom split: Roommate A pays $50, Roommate B pays $30, Roommate C pays $40

## Marking Payments
When someone pays:
1. Open the bill
2. Mark their share as **Paid**
3. The bill updates automatically

---

## Good Practices
- Add bills as soon as they arrive
- Add due dates so reminders work
- Keep bill names consistent (ex: always “Electricity”)

---

## If Someone Pays Late
You can:
- Send a reminder notification
- Add a note to the bill history (if supported)
