# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Do all roommates need accounts?
Yes. Each roommate needs an account so chores and bills can be tracked fairly.

### Can I join multiple households?
If your team limits to one household per account, then no.
If your team supports multiple, explain how switching works.

### What happens if someone moves out?
Admins can remove them. Bills and chore history remain for record-keeping.

### Can I edit or delete a chore/bill?
Yes, if your app supports it. Typically the creator (or admin) can edit/delete.

### Does NARLA handle real money payments?
Usually no—NARLA tracks who owes what. If you support payments, explain clearly:
- What providers you use
- Whether card info is stored (usually it should not be)

### Is my data private?
Only household members should see household data. Passwords are never visible.

### What if someone refuses to mark chores complete?
The system can show who is overdue. The best fix is household agreement + reminders.

### What devices are supported?
Any modern browser. Mobile support depends on release platform.
